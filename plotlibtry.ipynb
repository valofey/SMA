    "# Slime Mould Algorithm Simulation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook presents a simulation of a Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA) using Python. The primary objective of this simulation is to implement this metaheuristic in a natural setting (agents searching for food). Initially, I contemplated employing compute shaders for this simulation to harness the power of parallel computation and produce nice visuals. However, to maintain simplicity and accessibility, I opted for Matplotlib, a widely used Python library for data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SMA simulation is built on several core concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent Movement**: Agents move towards food sources based on a calculated 'smell' or odor map.\n",
    "- **Oscillation**: Agents' velocity changes periodically, to model state switching.\n",
    "- **Odor Map**: This map represents the intensity of food odors across the grid, guiding agents towards food sources.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Behavior**: Agent behavior and movement are influenced by various factors, including their position, the odor map, and an adjustable parameter `A_param`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation uses NumPy for efficient numerical computations and Matplotlib for visualizing the simulation steps. Additionally, interactive widgets provided by `ipywidgets` allow users to customize the simulation parameters like the number of agents, food sources, grid size, and simulation steps."

    "- `vb`: A variable bias component, influencing random movement of the agent.\n",
    "- `vc`: A variable component, dynamically calculated for each simulation step, affecting directed movement.\n",
    "- `direction`: A NumPy array representing the direction vector from the agent towards the closest food source.\n",
    "- `distance`: The distance from the agent to the closest food source.\n",
    "- `GRID_SIZE`: The size of the simulation grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functionality\n",
    "1. **Movement Calculation**:\n",
    "   - If the distance to the food source is less than half the grid size, the agent's movement is primarily influenced by `vb`, simulating a random search.\n",
    "   - If the distance is greater or equal to half the grid size, the movement is primarily directed by `vc`, simulating a more targeted approach towards the food source.\n",
    "2. **Position Update**: The agent's position is updated based on the calculated movement.\n",
    "3. **Boundary Check**: Ensures that the new position does not exceed the boundaries of the grid. This is achieved using `np.clip` to keep the agent's position within the limits of the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Returns\n",
    "- A tuple representing the new position (x, y) of the agent on the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is a key component in the SMA simulation, dictating the movement strategy of each agent. It balances random exploration with directed movement towards food sources, reflecting the adaptive behavior of real-world slime moulds in response to environmental stimuli."
